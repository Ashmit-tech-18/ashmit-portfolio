# Ashmit Shukla - Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio. This is a complete full-stack web application built from the ground up using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey.

* **React Router:** For handling client-side navigation between pages.
* **Axios:** For making API requests to the backend.
* **react-tsparticles:** For the interactive particle background.
* **CSS3:** For all the custom styling and animations.

### Backend (Server)

* **Node.js:** As the JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** As the web server framework.
* **MongoDB:** As the NoSQL database to store application data.
* **Mongoose:** As the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
* **CORS:** To enable cross-origin requests from the frontend.
* **Dotenv:** To manage environment variables securely.
